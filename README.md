# misc
Miscellaneous, semi-useless/useful Python scripts.

* `aaa.py`: output screams.
* `despace.py`: remove spaces from a string (e.g. an obfuscated URL).
* `IOLogic.py`: provide some functions related to getting input and printing.
* `self_producing_program.py`: print itself with a stupid cheat (only works if
executed explicitly with the `python` program, e.g. `python
self_producing_program.py`.
* `maths/letter_number.py`: find out the position of a letter in the alphabet,
and vice versa.
* `maths/nth_col_questions.py`: find out which questions are part of the nth
column of a textbook.
* `maths/primes.py`: home-grown method of finding primes.
